Because of the finite number of processed samples, both components are affected by a spectral leakage. Scientific literature has widely investigated the leakage of the fundamental and its higher harmonics, which can be prevented if the sampling and the input frequencies are synchronized accurately. Conversely, effect of the finite number of samples on the {PSD} of {DeltaSigma-shaped} wideband noise has not been treated in the technical literature yet. To date, windows commonly used for reducing leakage of the fundamental (i.e., the Hanning, {Blackman-Harris,} or flattop sequences) are also used for windowing the {DeltaSigma-shaped} quantization noise. By noticing that published {PSDs} of low-order {DeltaSigma} modulators are usually obtained by employing the Hanning window Norsworthy {(Oversampling} {Delta-Sigma} Data Converters: Theory, Design, and Simulation.

	abstract = " To solve the problem of constrained redundancy reliability optimization, several heuristic algorithms have been developed in the literature. Most of these algorithms search for the solutions remaining within the feasible boundary e.g. [15], [20]. Perhaps the most interesting \& efficient heuristic algorithm in terms of solution quality is that given by {KYA,} in which the search is made not only in the feasible region but also into the bounded infeasible region by making an excursion, which returns to the feasible region with a possibly improved solution. In this paper, a heuristic algorithm based on the penalty function approach is proposed to solve the constrained redundancy optimization problem for complex systems. An excursion is made into the infeasible region, but an adaptive penalty function helps the search not to go too far into the infeasible region. Thus, promising feasible \& infeasible regions of the search space are explored efficiently \& effectively to identify finally an optimal or near optimal solution. Computational experiments are conducted on 11 sets of problems (10 with linear constraints, and 1 with nonlinear constraints); each with 10 different randomly generated initial solutions. Comparison is made between the proposed algorithm {P-Alg,} {N-N} algorithm [15], Shi algorithm [20], and {KYA} [9] . It is observed that {P-Alg} performs consistently better than others, showing an overall improvement in various measures of performance. Besides, as {P-Alg} does not require any assumptions on the nature of the objective \& constraint functions, it can solve a wide variety of problems.",

Since 1985, various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run. However, the few comparative studies of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative and are often restricted to a few approaches. In this paper, four multiobjective {EAs} are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis. Furthermore, we introduce a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization, the strength Pareto {EA} {(SPEA),} that combines several features of previous multiobjective {EAs} in a unique manner. It is characterized by (a) storing nondominated solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population, (b) evaluating an individual's fitness dependent on the number of external nondominated points that dominate it, (c) preserving population diversity using the Pareto dominance relationship, and (d) incorporating a clustering procedure in order to reduce the nondominated set without destroying its characteristics. The proof-of-principle results obtained on two artificial problems as well as a larger problem, the synthesis of a digital hardware-software multiprocessor system, suggest that {SPEA} can be very effective in sampling from along the entire Pareto-optimal front and distributing the generated solutions over the tradeoff surface. Moreover, {SPEA} clearly outperforms the other four multiobjective {EAs} on the 0/1 knapsack problem",

Many researchers take the high-dimensional Rosenbrock function as a unimodal function by instinct. In 2001 and 2002, Hansen and Deb found that the Rosenbrock function is not a unimodal function for higher dimensions although no theoretical analysis was provided. This paper shows that the n-dimensional (n = 4∼30) Rosenbrock function has 2 minima, and analysis is proposed to verify this. The local minima in some cases are presented.

This paper analytically shows how such delay affects the equivalence between the {CT} modulator loop filter and its {DT} counterpart. The effect of this delay on modulator dynamic range is studied through simulation for the standard double-integration (low pass) {CT} modulator and its equivalent fourth-order f{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/4 band pass circuit. For the first time, the results are extended to higher order low-pass and bandpass designs, as well as multibit designs.

A fast filter-level step evaluates the performance of all loop-filter topologies and passes the accepted solutions to the architecture-level optimization step which maps the filters on feasible architectures and evaluates their performance. The power consumption of each accepted architecture is estimated and the best top-ten solutions in terms of the ratio of peak signal-to-noise+distortion ratio versus power consumption are further optimized for yield.

The {HTGA} approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm {(TGA),} which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a {TGA.} Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the {HTGA} approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented {HTGA} approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented {HTGA} approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the {XOR} problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed {GA-based} approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented {HTGA} approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.",

We apply the resulting methodology to generate an initial population of points that are scattered uniformly over the feasible solution space, so that the algorithm can evenly scan the feasible solution space once to locate good points for further exploration in subsequent iterations. In addition, we apply the quantization technique and orthogonal design to tailor a new crossover operator, such that this crossover operator can generate a small, but representative sample of points as the potential offspring.

The orthogonal design with the factor analysis, an experimental design method, is applied to the genetic algorithm, to make the algorithm be more robust, statistically sound and quickly convergent. A crossover operator formed by the orthogonal array and the factor analysis is presented. First, this crossover operator can generate a small, but representative sample of points as offspring. After all of the better genes of these offspring are selected, an optimal offspring better than its parents is then generated in the end. Moreover, a check-and-repair operator is adopted to make the infeasible chromosomes generated by the crossover and mutation operators feasible, and make the feasible chromosomes better. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can find optimal or close-to-optimal solutions with less computation burden. ",

A novel topology for constructing stable interpolative modulators of arbitrary order is described. Analysis of this topology shows that with proper design of the modulator coefficients, stability is not a limitation to higher order modulators. Furthermore, complete control over placement of the poles and zeros of the quantization noise response allows treatment of the modulation process as a high-pass filter for quantization noise. Higher order modulators are shown not only to greatly reduce oversampling requirements for high-resolution conversion applications, but also to randomize the quantization noise, avoiding the need for dithering. An experimental fourth-order modulator breadboard demonstrates stability and feasibility, achieving a {90-dB} dynamic range over the {20-kHz} audio bandwidth with a sampling rate of 2.1 {MHz.} A generalized simulation software package has been developed to mimic time-domain behavior for oversampling modulators.

This paper examines the design and implementation of a {CMOS} ΣΔ modulator for digital-audio {A/D} conversion that operates from a single {1.8-V} power supply. A cascaded modulator that maintains a large full-scale input range while avoiding signal clipping at internal nodes is introduced. The experimental modulator has been designed with fully differential switched-capacitor integrators employing different input and output common-mode levels and boosted clock drivers in order to facilitate low voltage operation. Precise control of common-mode levels, high power supply noise rejection, and low power dissipation are obtained through the use of two-stage, class {A/AB} operational amplifiers.

This technique results in a large number of simultaneous linear equations the solution of which determines the filter's impulse response. The filter's frequency samples which are used to implement the filter are then determined by computing the discrete Fourier transform of this impulse response. In this brief, a modification of this technique is developed. This modified technique also approximates a desired frequency response by minimizing the mean square error over the stopbands subject to constraints on the filter's amplitude response. Additionally, however, it allows passbands to be approximated by a weighted mean square error. This modified technique results in a set of simultaneous linear equations, the solution of which directly determines the filter's nonzero frequency samples.

A crossover operator formed by the orthogonal array and the factor analysis is presented. First, this crossover operator can generate a small, but representative sample of points as offspring. After all of the better genes of these offspring are selected, an optimal offspring better than its parents is then generated in the end. Moreover, a check-and-repair operator is adopted to make the infeasible chromosomes generated by the crossover and mutation operators feasible, and make the feasible chromosomes better.

High-order {BPSDMs} with different quality factors {(Q)} are demonstrated. It shows that coefficient spread is significantly reduced, especially for {high-Q} applications.

In the proposed approach, the filter coefficients are treated as chromosomes to be optimized and the effects of finite word length are minimized by considering the filter as a cascade of two sections. The {OGA} employs an integer encoding scheme for chromosome construction whereby the filter coefficients are expressed in terms of sums of powers of two to obtain the multiplierless design. The optimization is carried out by minimizing an objective function based on the amplitude response error. Experimental results show that the {OGA} approach leads to improved amplitude response relative to that of an equivalent direct-form cascade filter obtained using the Remez exchange algorithm",

The present paper attempts to resolve this problem by proposing a simple hybrid ``damping'' boundary condition that combines the characteristics offered by the existing ``absorbing'' and ``reflecting'' boundaries.
